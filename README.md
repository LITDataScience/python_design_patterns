# Design Patterns in Python
Simplified and easy to understand design pattern principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
The first design principle is: `Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)`

Another term connected with the SRP is `Separation of Concern`(SOC). Both are one and the same thing.

This pattern/class signifies a pattern which is meant to do one thing only and should not focus on another tasks.

### Open-Closed Principle
The second design principle is: `Open-Closed Principle(OCP)`

This principle states that when you add a new functionality, add it via an extension, and not via modification.
i.e.
open for extension, closed for modification.

To counter this, we have an Enterprise patter: `Specification Pattern`
